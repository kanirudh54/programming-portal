==================
This project is made by a team of 15 people. It is an academic project.This includes a website and a android app.

My contributions
================
1. Android App
2. Forgot password feature: a new password is generated and sent to email id.
3. Few changes in the html and php for better experience in Android App
4. Made a backup script

About Android App: In this app I have implemented the webview feature availabe in android SDK. We had thhree options
for making the app:
1. Webview
2. Json handler(same as webview but parsing only the data needed. So chose webview over it)
3. Online Compiler(Couldn't customize the user experince)

So chose webview and made sure that that the CSS part is mobile compatible(used bootstrap)


Usage of Android App
====================
Set up the website first. Then give the address of the website. and use it.
